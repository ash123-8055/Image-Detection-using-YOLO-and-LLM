# Image-Detection-using-YOLO-and-LLM
 This project integrates YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection with an LLM to generate descriptive details of an image. YOLO detects and classifies objects. The information from YOLO is fed into Ollama, which processes this data to generate a coherent, natural language description of the scene.
